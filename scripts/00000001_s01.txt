MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, others.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old male with bilateral hand tremor.  Patient reports that the tremor waxes and wanes.  He had difficulty providing the history.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
TECHNICAL:  No significant issues.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background includes a well organized pattern with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements why deeper stages of sleep were not sustained. 
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record. 
Hyperventilation did not activate the record significantly. 
Heart rate 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an 
important consideration, a follow up tracing capture in deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
